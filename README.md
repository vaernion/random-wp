# Random Wikipages ![](https://github.com/vaernion/random-wp/workflows/Build%20Expo%20&%20Deploy%20to%20GH%20Pages/badge.svg)
Simple app to fetch semi-random data and display it intuitively.

Displays summaries of random Wikipedia pages in a chosen language, with easy language selection and refreshing, and a link to the full article.
Primarily designed as mobile app with Expo CLI. Web version is an afterthought, but is decent enough. No responsive design (yet?).
